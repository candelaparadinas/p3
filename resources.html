            <h2>BLOGGER RESOURCES</h2>
            <p class="uppercase">BLOGGER RESOURCES IS A FREE LIST OF TOOLS TO HELP YOU BUILD AN EFFICIENT, WELL-DESIGNED, SUCCESSFUL FOOD BLOG.</p>
            <p>We’ve been fortunate enough to run a food blog business for 10+ years fully employing 5 people and several more contractors. Even if self-employment isn’t your dream, we’ve learned a lot through our journey and think we can offer some killer advice to help you along the way, too.</p>
            
            <h3>Quick Guide:</h3>
            <p>The order of these resources is intuitive to how you would build a blog from start to finish, starting with website hosts, and onto themes, plugins, and tools. Eventually, you’ll find sections like how to monetize your blog. Work your way through this list as you see fit – either from start to finish, or choose where to jump in according to your present needs.</p>
